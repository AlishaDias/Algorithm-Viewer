# Sorting Visualizer iOS App
This iOS app provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms, allowing users to observe the sorting process in real-time. It offers an interactive interface where users can select different array sizes, sorting algorithms, and visualize how the algorithms rearrange the elements to sort the array.

## Features:
Visual representation of sorting algorithms: Users can see how different sorting algorithms, such as Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort, rearrange elements to sort an array.
Interactive UI: The app provides an intuitive interface with segmented controls for selecting array sizes and sorting algorithms, as well as a button to initiate the sorting process.
Real-time animation: Sorting algorithms are visualized in real-time through animations, allowing users to observe the sorting process step by step.
Customizable array sizes: Users can choose from predefined array sizes to visualize sorting algorithms on different scales.
Swift implementation: The app is implemented in Swift, making use of UIKit for building the user interface and Core Animation for animating the sorting process.

## How to Use:
Open the app on your iOS device.
Select the desired array size using the segmented control.
Choose a sorting algorithm from the segmented control.
Tap the "Sort" button to initiate the sorting process.
Observe the sorting algorithm in action as the elements are rearranged in real-time.
